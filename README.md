# Space-Escape

# What's it about:
 Space Escape is a first-person shooter game. I worked with my friends Jordan, Tim, Lindsey, and Damian to develop this game. We integrated features like robust enemies, engaging background music, multiple levels etc. All the background images and visual effects as well as the background music are solely our own work made from scratch. The purpose of the game is to help the alien (player) escape the spaceship by killing or by avoiding all the enemies and the lightnings.
 
We can watch a short gameplay of the game here:
